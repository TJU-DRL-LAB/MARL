# ASN: 
Action Semantics Network (ASN) to characterize such action semantics for more efficient multiagent coordination. Specifically, each agent's action set can be naturally divided into two types: one type containing actions that affect environmental information or its private properties and the other type containing actions that directly influence other agents (i.e., their private properties). Intuitively, the estimation of performing actions with different types should be evaluated separately by explicitly considering different information. We refer to the property that different actions may have different impacts on other agents as action semantics. We can leverage the action semantics information to improve an agent's policy/Q network design toward more efficient multiagent learning. Therefore, instead of inputting an agent's total observation into one network, ASN consists of several sub-modules that take different parts of the agent's observation as input according to the semantics of actions. In this way, ASN can effectively avoid the negative influence of those irrelevant information, and thus provide a more accurate estimation of performing each action. Besides, ASN is general and can be incorporated into existing deep MARL frameworks to improve the performance of existing DRL algorithms.
