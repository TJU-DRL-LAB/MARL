# Hybrid action space
Discrete-continuous hybrid action space is a natural setting in many practical problems, such as robot control and game AI. However, most previous Reinforcement Learning (RL) works only demonstrate the success in controlling with either discrete or continuous action space, while seldom take into account the hybrid action space.  For example, in robot soccer, the agent not only needs to choose whether to shoot or pass the ball (i.e., discrete actions) but also the associated angle and force (i.e., continuous parameters).
