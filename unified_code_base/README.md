# A Unified MARL Codebase Incorporating SMAC, MPE and Multiagent MuJoCo Environments and Typical MARL Algorithms.

This repo contains the typical multiagent environments and algorithms.
  * It includes three typical environmentsï¼š SMAC, MPE and Multiagent MuJoCo.
  * It includes implementations for Independent DQN, VDN, QMIX, MADDPG, COMIX and Independent DDPG.

This codebase is built on top of the [PyMARL](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.
