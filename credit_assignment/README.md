# Multiagent credit assignment problem
For cooperative Markov games, all agents could only receive a shared team reward. However, in most cases, only a subset of agents contribute to the reward, and we need to identify which agents contribute more (less) and reward (punish) them accordingly. The target is then guide the less contributed agents to contribute more and thus the team reward could be further improved.
