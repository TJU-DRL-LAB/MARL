# Self-supervised RL

A unified opensource code implementation of algorithms for Self-supervised Reinforcement Leanring (SSRL) with Representations.

This repo contains representative research works of TJU-RL-Lab on the topic of Self-supervised Representation Learning for RL.

This repo will be constantly updated to include new researches made by TJU-RL-Lab. 
(The development of this repo is in progress at present.)


## A Description of the Taxonmy for Self-supervised RL with Representation

This repo follow a systematic taxnomy proposed by TJU-RL-Lab, which consists of:
- SSRL with State Representation
- SSRL with Action Representation
- SSRL with Policy Representation
- SSRL with Environment (and Task) Representation
- SSRL with Other Representation

For a tutorial of this taxnomy, we refer the reader to our ZhiHu blog series: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/413321572
